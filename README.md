ToDoApp keeps track of all your tasks.
It's very useful.


Ever felt like there are too many things to do, and it sometimes,
render itself hard to remember? Of course, you have better things
to stuff your brain with. There's no point in using precious brain
memory for trivial things in general, and things you can easily
look up in particular. If you share the same thoughts, then
maybe ToDoApp is for you!

Outsource your task tracking and lead a better, and hopefully more
productive, life.
